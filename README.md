## Objective of the Project
The objective of the project on election turnout trends is to analyze historical voter turnout data to uncover patterns and predict future turnout rates. The aim is to identify key factors influencing voter participation, such as demographics, socioeconomic conditions, and election-specific dynamics. Insights from this analysis can assist policymakers and stakeholders in improving voter engagement and addressing turnout disparities.

## Tools and Libraries Used
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
 
## Data Source(s)
The data used in this project was gathered from:
- Publicly available election datasets (e.g., [Election Commission Website(#)], [Kaggle(#)])
- Socioeconomic and demographic datasets from government statistical departments
- Historical news and articles for contextual analysis

## Execution Steps
To replicate the results or use the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Adjust Layout and Display.
4. Run the google colab or Python script for data analysis: python main.py.

## Summary 
- Key factors influencing voter turnout:
-  Demographic features (age, income, education).
- Historical turnout trends.
- Election-specific factors like candidate popularity.
- Highlighted regions with high and low turnout, offering actionable insights for stakeholders to improve voter participation.

## Challenges Faced
- Data Availability: Limited datasets required merging multiple sources and extensive cleaning.
- Feature Selection: Identifying key features from socioeconomic indicators was time-intensive.
- Model Overfitting: Addressed using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Interpretability: Balancing model accuracy with explainability was challenging, especially for complex algorithms.
